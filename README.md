## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

[1]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

You will also need:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- python3, you'll need this runnable as `python` so I recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- npm
- sass

## Running

You'll need docker running for the database.
Once docker is running, run: `docker-compose up -d` in this directory to start postgres.

Then run `./bin/recreate_db` to provision the database correctly.

Create a file `dev-config.edn` in the root if it does not exist. Put this content in it:
```
{:dev true
 :port 3000
 :nrepl-port 7000
 :database-url "postgres://basha_user:basha_password@localhost:5432/dev"
 :token-secret "0f6cf8sdf4f58cfd" ;; <- this token secret can be any random string
}
```

First, run `lein install` and `npm install` in the main directory, then you'll need three tabs open...

### Tab 1:
`lein scss :development watch`

### Tab 2:
`npm run watch`

### Tab 3:

In this tab, you'll need the python env setup first. If you're using conda:

First time only:
```
conda create -n basha python=3.8.2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Every time (including first time):
`conda activate basha`

Then run:

```
lein repl
> (migrate)
> (start)
```

**NOTE:**

There is a small chance the migrate command will fail.
If this happens, go to the file `./resources/migrations/20211012223102-add-users-table.up.sql` and comment out line 1.
